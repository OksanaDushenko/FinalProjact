#### Description:
 Hello, my name is Oksana and this si my final project. This is a my web-page for sharing my photos.

 My hobby is photographing that's why I decided to create a web-page with my portfolio.

 On main page you can see nav-bar menu with different categories of photos such as portrets, nature, architecture and prodact.
When we click on the button you go to page where you can see a slide-show and click on the button to cycle through elements.
When you return to the main page you can choose another categories and also you can leave your name, email and feedback for colaboration. After submiting your feedback I can see it in my database.

 In my final project I've used my knowladge which i havegot on this course such as:
 - html
 - css
 - java-script
 - python
 - sql

  Architecture:
  webDB.db - the database where I have storaged feedback.
  app.py - the python code is using for navigation between web-pages and also to populate my database with your feedback.
